Project Title: UPI Transaction Analysis using Power BI

This project involved analyzing Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transaction data to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to digital payments in India. Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that showcased monthly transaction volumes, values, growth rates, and platform-wise performance (e.g., PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm). The analysis helped visualize the rapid adoption of UPI and highlighted user preferences, peak transaction periods, and regional usage trends, enabling a better understanding of Indiaâ€™s digital payment ecosystem.
